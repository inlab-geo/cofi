Welcome to the CoFI Documentation! CoFI, the Common Framework for Inference, is an 
open-source tool that bridges the gap between domain expertise and inference, within 
and beyond the field of geoscience.

Whether you're a student, an educator, or an industry professional, CoFI is your go-to 
tool. It simplifies the process of applying inference techniques, allowing for a wide 
range of applications from academic research and teaching to solving real-world 
geoscience problems in the industry. With its user-friendly, flexible and accessible
interface, CoFI empowers you to focus on what truly matters - the science.

    # CoFI API has flexible ways of defining an inversion problem. For instance:
    import cofi

    inv_problem = cofi.BaseProblem()
    inv_problem.set_objective(my_objective_func)
    inv_problem.set_initial_model(my_starting_point)

    # Once a problem is defined, `cofi` can tell you what inference tools you can 
    # use based on what level of information you've provided:
    inv_problem.suggest_tools()   # a tree will be printed

    # Run an inversion with these lines:
    inv_options = cofi.InversionOptions()
    inv_options.set_tool("torch.optim")
    inv_options.set_params(options={"num_iterations": 50, "algorithm": "Adam"})

    inv = cofi.Inversion(inv_problem, inv_options)
    result = inv.run()
    print(result.success)
    print(result.model)
