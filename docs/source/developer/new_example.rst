New forward example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CoFI doesn't have any forward solvers in the package itself. Instead, we manage
all of our forward code as a part of the example gallery maintained in the
`cofi-examples <https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi-examples>`_ respository.

Follow the instructions
`here <https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi-examples#contribution>`_ for details on
how to contribute to the example repository.

Our `tutorials <tutorials/generated/index.html>`_ page is a good place to start learning about how to
plug in an inversion problem in ``cofi``. Furthermore, there are examples with increasing 
complexity presented in the `example gallery <examples/generated/index.html>`_ 
page for you to learn from.
