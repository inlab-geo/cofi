A surface wave is a wave that travels along an interface between to media. Rayleigh wave and Love wave are ealstic surface waves that travel along the surface of solid media, for example the surface of the Earth. The depth to which these waves penetrate is a function of the wave type and wavelength; thus in turn the group and phase velocity at which the wave travels is a function of wavelength and wave type.

If velocity changes with depth, as is the case in the Earth, we observe what is known as surface wave dispersion, that is the phase and group velocity are a function of the freqeuncy. In contrast to this for a constant velocity half space no dispersion would occur. Thus surface wave dispersion offers a way to probe the earth, with dispersion measurements typically obtained thorugh a spectral analysis of the observed timeseries. Applications span a wide range of scales from imaging the mantle to recovering paleochannel networks.
