These are data sets for inversion of surface wave dispersion and receiver functions.

Just read an run the shell script DOIT.deep

Note:

Before you try a receiver function inversion, you must ensure that
the receiver functions are in the correct format for your machine.
Do this

cd JOINT
for i in R*[05]
do
saccvt -I < $i > tmp ; mv tmp $i
done
cd ..

cd RFTN
for i in R*[05]
do
saccvt -I < $i > tmp ; mv tmp $i
done
cd ..
